crisp: a C lisp

Build with:

    CFLAGS="-Wall" make crisp

Some syntax documentation and testing code is in the tests file.
A minimal set of functions is implemented in C, but friendlier functions
like "and" and "not" are defined in the tests file.

Source those and start the interpreter:

    cat tests - | ./crisp
